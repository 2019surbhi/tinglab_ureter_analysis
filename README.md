# Tinglab ureter analysis


## Overview

This repository harbors analysis code and files relevent to scRNA sequencing analysis relevent to our recent work "**Ureter single-cell and spatial mapping reveal cell types, architecture, and signaling networks**". Preprint avaialable [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.473889v1)

This code repository utilizes many published scRNA analysis tools such as **Seurat**and **Monocle3**, among other available tools, to explore the cellular heterogenity of the human ureters (n=10) using 10X Genomics 3' single cell RNA sequencing platform.
